        <p>Due to changes in the SoundCloud API, many previous functions of SoundByte no longer work:</p>
        <p>It is no longer possible for 3rd-party apps to access the logged in users stream.</p>
        <p>It is no longer possible for 3rd-party apps to access top charts and trending music.</p>
        <p>You must now be logged in to access the SoundCloud API. All SoundCloud functions of the app will not work without being logged in (including listening to music).</p>
        <p>In addition to the above, SoundByte Account functionality has been removed from the app.</p>
        <p>YouTube login is still broken. API access may work, playback may work.</p>

    <h1 id="h-intro">SoundByte</h1>
    <p>SoundByte was a  music client originally built for Windows Phone and later ported to Windows 10 &amp; Xbox One which combined the ability to play local music on your device, alongside SoundCloud and YouTube content (and at one point, Fanburst content).</p>

    <p>You could listen to music, create and edit playlists, stream YouTube videos and more from a simple, clean, ad-free music client.</p>

    <p>SoundByte also integrated into more advanced Windows 10 features such as live tiles, media controls (skip or pause tracks using your keyboard), Cortana voice commands, and Windows Timeline.</p>

    <p>This page summarizes the development history of SoundByte, and why it's now effectively dead.</p>

    <h3 id="h-idea">The Idea</h3>
    <p>
        SoundByte was originally born out of a personal need for a UWP SoundCloud client for Windows Phone (and Windows 10). Windows 10 had
        just released (2015) alongside the new UWP app development framework. The idea of UWP intrigued me (one app running on a range of devices).
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point in time, there was already a SoundCloud client for Windows Phone (orginally designed for Windows Phone 7/8) called
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/audiocloudapp/">AudioCloud</a>. It didn't quite tick all the boxes for me, so I decided, why not create my own?
    </p>
    <p>
        SoundByte would later drop support for Windows Phone, add support for Xbox, multiple music providers, local music, SoundByte Accounts, and even briefly work on iPhones. But before
        any of that could happen, the app had to start somewhere...

    <h6>2015 - First Sketches</h6>
    <p>I can only vaguely remember sketching this out. I recall being on Holiday somewhere locally in New Zealand without access to my computer.</p>
    <img class="image pure-img" src="~/images/soundbyte/soundcloud_ui_draft.jpg" />
    <br /><br />

    <p>The sketch describes what would eventually become version 0.4 of SoundByte in a very rough format (see image below).</p>

    <h6>2015 - Development Screenshots</h6>
    <p>Some mobile app screenshots that I had gathered throughout development:</p>
    <img class="image pure-img" src="~/images/soundbyte/mobile_dev.jpg" />
    <br /><br />

    <h6>January 2016 - Going Public</h6>
    <p>
        After spending a month or two in development. I finally went public about the application and
        started to gather feedback. You can still find the original Reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/40w38r/uwp_soundcloud_player_ui_feedback/">here</a>,
        alongside the Imgur album <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rPwog">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The linked Reddit thread is also where I first met Dennis Bednarz (Denaxin) who would help out immensely with the application.</p>
    <img class="image pure-img" src="~/images/soundbyte/soundcloud_ad_old.jpg" />
    <br /><br />

    <h6>July 2016 - Preview Release</h6>
    <p>The app is now called SoundByte and is on the store (as a preview)!</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/4u0kob/soundbyte_preview_soundcloud_uwp_app/">Reddit announcement post</a> and a <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/developer-submission-soundbyte-preview-soundcloud-uwp-app/">MSPowerUser Developer Submission</a> from the time.</p>

    <h6>November 2016 - Xbox Support</h6>
    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/5ahtrw/soundbyte_a_soundcloud_app_now_available_for_xbox/">Reddit Thread</a></p>

    <h6>February 2017 - Xbox Optimization &amp; Project Neon Development</h6>
    <p>
        Optimized for Xbox (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/5rkssv/soundbyte_soundcloud_app_now_features/">Reddit Thread</a>, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/6silo">Imgur Album</a>).
    </p>

    <p>
        During this same time period, I started a major redesign of SoundByte with the help of Dennis Bednarz. This redesign would introduce a global shell which would encapsulate
        all content within the application (previously every page was unique and separate). This shell stuck throughout the many future redesigns of SoundByte. You can see the initial
        development of the shell below (note how the entire previous app is contained within the shell):

    </div>
    <br /><br />

    <h6>April 2017 - Project Neon</h6>
    <p>New major redesign of SoundByte inspired by Project Neon (which would eventually become Fluent Design by Microsoft). First two screenshots are from the desktop app, next two screenshots are from the Xbox app.</p>

    <h3 id="h-future">Future</h3>

    <p>
        SoundByte account functionality is read-only as of May 21, 2021 (this also disables registering new accounts).
        If you login with your SoundByte account, you can also export all of your data (history, likes, and most played).
    </p>

    <p>
        On January 31st, 2022 the SoundByte API will be shutdown. An app update will be released which removes SoundByte account functionality from the app. The account
        login system will be moved to a lightweight API hosted on this current website.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/DominicMaas/SoundByteOSS">The app is open source</a> if you want to build your own version / mess around with it, and the server (stripped down) will also be published when I have some time.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was a good ride! The opportunities that I have gained by creating this little app have changed my life! The app will stay in the Microsoft
        Store, but I cannot guarantee any future fixes.
    </p>

    <p>I'll quickly summarize the current blockers preventing future SoundByte development:</p>

    <h6>SoundCloud Support</h6>

    <p>SoundCloud API changes requiring all streamed music to be authenticated (you must be logged into the application, this also applies strict stream quota limits).</p>
    <p>SoundCloud API changes making grabbing the logged in users stream (and trending music) very difficult without workarounds, which I don't have time to invest in.</p>

    <h6>YouTube Support</h6>

    <p>
        With YouTube, I might be able to get support working again, but I need to figure out
        why the new login client id is not working (and then get the new client id approved by YouTube
        which might not happen because of the nature of this app). This will take time which I don't have at the moment.
