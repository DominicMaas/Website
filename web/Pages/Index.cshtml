                Hey, my name is Dominic. I'm primarily a .NET developer focusing on Windows GUI platforms such as WinUI 3, UWP and WPF, alongside Android via Xamarin Forms.
            </p>
            <p>
                Professionally, I've built software for <a href="https://www.staffpad.net/">StaffPad</a> remotely and <a href="https://www.inex.co.nz/">Independent Extrusions</a> locally.
                You can check what I've done by taking a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a>. I'm currently building and maintaining software for StaffPad and Independent Extrusions.
            </p>
            <p>
                I studied at
                <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/">The University of Waikato</a> from 2018 to 2021, and was certified with a Bachelor of Science (major in Computer Science) on the 6th of September 2022.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my own time I like to expand my skills by building things I don't usually work with, such as game mods, games, embedded software etc. You can take a look at the projects section of my website to see <a href="/projects">what I've worked on</a>.
                While not programming, I enjoy running, biking, <a href="/photography">photography</a>, astronomy and rocketry.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is built using ASP.NET Razor Pages. I've tried to keep things simple and lightweight!
