        Hi, I'm a software developer specializing with the Windows GUI platform (technologies such as WinUI 3, UWP, WPF, really anything XAML related).
        I'm currently building Muse Hub at <a href="https://mu.se/">Muse Group</a>.
        Previously I've built software for <a href="https://www.staffpad.net/">StaffPad</a> and <a href="https://www.inex.co.nz/">Independent Extrusions</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I studied at
        <a href="https://www.waikato.ac.nz/">The University of Waikato</a> from 2018 to 2021 (where I had a great time meeting new people and working on amazing projects), and was certified with a Bachelor of Science (major in Computer Science) in 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my own time I like to expand my skills by building things I don't usually work with, such as game mods, graphics, embedded software etc. You can take a look at the projects section of my website to see <a href="/projects">what I've worked on</a>.
        While not programming, I enjoy running, biking, <a href="/photography">photography</a>, astronomy and rocketry.

    <p>Here's a photo of me in front of Humphrey the Sea Elephant!</p>

     <p>
        This website is built using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core">ASP.NET Razor Pages</a> and <a href="https://htmx.org">HTMX</a>. HTMX is used to provide an extra layer of interactivity, but is not required for the website to work.

        I've tried to keep things simple and light-weight! Numerous design changes and tweaks, but I'm pretty happy where things are at the moment.
