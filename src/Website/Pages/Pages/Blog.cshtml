    Mess of notes!

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>Blog posts should have markdown content (rendered to HTML)</p></li>
    <li><p>Automatically generated RSS feed</p></li>
    <li><p>Two forms of posts, long form and threads (no, not you meta!)</p></li>
    <li><p>Threads are more suited to posts that go over time and will be updated frequently. Will be separated into timeline like sections. Sections can be linked to individually (want to use this for bike packing)</p></li>
    <li><p>Picture support? Where do we host these. Maybe just on this site? Cloudflare may handle it</p></li>
    <li><p>Code support (for pico filesystem)</p></li>
    <li><p>Comments? How? Github? GitHub Discussions?</p></li>
    <li><p>Migrate existing pages to blog posts</p></li>
</ul>
